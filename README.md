## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **WebSocket Connection Fails**
   - Check firewall settings
   - Verify port 3000 is accessible
   - Ensure WebSocket support in proxy/load balancer

2. **High Latency**
   - Use server closer to users
   - Scale up server resources
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Mobile Touch Issues**
   - Ensure viewport meta tag is set
   - Verify touch event handlers
   - Test on actual devices

### Performance Optimization
- Use process manager (PM2) for production
- Enable gzip compression
- Implement connection pooling
- Add Redis for session management (multi-instance)
